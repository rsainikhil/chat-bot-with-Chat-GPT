i have arranged/classified the projects according to their level of complexity

1: this is very simple just 4 lines of code but gives you only one kind of information which can be modifyed by you.
2: this is little complex thank first on but easy to understand the is a command promt/terminal based project (runs in terminal/command promt only no gui) so, you can      ask anything only through command promt
3: very easy but complex it has a beautiful gui and gives an experience like chat-GPT.

you can improvise all these code as per your will and wish.
